        <h6>AMERICAN GOTHIC 1930</h6>
        <small>Grant Devolson Wood</small>
        <hr>
        <p>Painted in Oil on Beaver Board, American Gothic was first displayed at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1930 and is still found there today. When it was first displayed, many critics took it to be a commentary on the repression and austerity of rural life in America.
        
        The painting was inspired by a house that Wood saw in southern Iowa. The house can be seen in the background of the painting. Wood then sought out models (his dentist and his sister) to represent the type of person he imagined would live in such a home. The spikes of the three-pronged pitchfork are at the centre of the painting.
    
        The three-pronged spear can be viewed as a symbol of hard labour and hard work. It seems to play with the American idea of the self-made man and the American Dream. Those who work hard will reap the rewards. The human subjects of this painting appear to be standing against a rich background of trees, with their gothic-style home over their shoulder. But judging by their expressions, they do not seem to be living a fulfilled or joyful life. There is an austerity in the painting and its depiction of working class people in 1930s America.</p>
